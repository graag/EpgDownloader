=head1 SYNOPSIS

 ./epgdownloader.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EpgDownloader is a converter between various Electronic Program Guides. It is plugin based to make it easy to implement new formats. 

This script reads the main configuration file and checks for available plugins. After that it reads channels file which describes how the programme guide data should be imported and saved. The last thing is to run the proper plugins.
